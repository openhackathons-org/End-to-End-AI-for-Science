# End-to-End AI for Science

This Bootcamp will provide researchers hands-on approaches on how to use NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, a framework that combines physics and partial differential equations (PDEs) with artificial intelligence (AI) to build robust models. Participants will also learn about the differences between Physics-driven and Data-driven approaches to AI. In addition, the Bootcamp will provide hands-on experience with visualizing the results of physics simulations using ParaView. This Lab will also introduce you to Earth2Studio where you get to try out different workflows for various Weather forecasting models!
