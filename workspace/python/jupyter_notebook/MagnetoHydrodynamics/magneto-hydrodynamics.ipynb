    "In this notebook, we will study the application of physics informed data-driven modeling to the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations representing an incompressible fluid in the presence of a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$. Our model will be built using a Tensor Factorized Fourier Neural Operator (tFNO), and trained in conjunction with the PDEs representing our system. The model is physics-informed during training by encoding known information about the physical system into the loss functions,  enabling generalization of the resulting model to a variety of settings in the solution space. Specifically, the PDEs and initial conditions are used as soft constraints learned by the neural network as its trains. Models covering different data regimes governed by the Reynolds number are trained using transfer learning to showcase how our model may be applied to both laminar and turbulent flows. The AI-accelerated surrogate model is compared to classical simulations to compare its throughput and accuracy.\n",

    "## Defining our Constraints - Setting up the PDE\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints are used to define the objectives for training our model. They house a set of nodes from which a computational graph is build for execution as well as the loss function. [PhysicsNeMo Sim](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/physicsnemo/physicsnemo-sym/index.html) provides utilities tailored for physics-informed machine learning, and uses abstracted APIs that allow users to think and model the problem from the lens of equations, constraints, etc. In this example, we will only leverage the physics-informed utilities to see how we can add physics to an existing data-driven model with ease while still maintaining the flexibility to define our own training loop and other details. The types of constraints used will be problem dependent. For this example, we can define the following constraints: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Loss**: Obtain simulation data and compare it to the PINO output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PDE Loss**: Use the known PDEs of the system to describe violations of the time evolution of our system\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraint Loss**: This loss describes constraints from the PDE. Specifically, the velocity divergence free condition of equation 3 and magnetic divergence free condition of equation 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Condition Loss**: Input field compared to the output at $t=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boundary Condition Loss**: Difference in boundary terms. In our case, we have a periodic boundary constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin setting up our constraints, we can start by defining the MHD equations using the `PDE` class from `physicsnemo.sym.eq.pde`. The process of converting our PDEs into a form that is compatible with `PhysicsNeMo` involves defining a class to hold our equations, called `MHD_PDE`, and including each term of the equations. Each variable of the equations is set up as a `Sympy` `Function`, which is then used to create an attribute of our `MHD_PDE` class that holds the final `equations`.\n",

    "The PDE loss describes violations of the time evolution of the PDEs and the PINO outputs. In order to make this comparison, the spatial and temporal derivatives of the output fields need to be computed. To do so, Fourier differentiation is used to calculate the spacial derivatives, and second order finite differencing is used for temporal derivatives. The output fields are the velocity in the $x$ direction ($u$), the velocity in the $y$ direction ($v$), and the magnetic vector potential (\\mathbf{A}). The PDE loss is then defined as the MSE loss between zero and the PDE, after putting all the terms on the same side of the equation.\n",

    "Our PINO model is composed of Tensor Factorized Neural Operators as the core component. Input fields are fed in as the input, which are composed of $u$, $v$, and $A$ initial conditions. The data is first lifted into a higher dimension representation by the neural network, P1. The data then enters the Fourier layers ($F_1$,...,$F_n$). Each Fourier layer consists of a sequence of non-logical integral operators, and nonlinear activation functions. $T_1$ represents a linear transform that employs CP decomposed tensors as weights, and $T_2$ represents a local linear transform. $\\sigma$ is the activation function, and $\\mathcal{F}$, $\\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ represent the Fourier transfrom and inverse Fourier transform respectively. At the end, $P_2$ projects back down into the input space, producing the output shown on the right which describes the next state of the system. This process is repeated to predict the time evolution of the system. "

    "PhysicsNeMo has two distinct styles, namely Core and Sym. PhysicsNeMo Sym is a framework providing pythonic APIs, algorithms and utilities to be used with PhysicsNeMo Core, while PhysicsNeMo Core interoperates with PyTorch directly. Working with PhysicsNeMo Core looks and feels more like a PyTorch workflow with some key utils like models, utils, and datapipes imported directly from `physicsnemo` itself. While some components of this workflow so far have borrowed from PhysicsNeMo Sym (`MHD_PDE`), the training workflow for this problem will be build primarily using the Core style. This will provide more flexibility over our training loop, and allow for further customizations to our workflow. The training script follows the standard flow of training models using pytorch. \n"

    "In practice, our system may not follow smooth, laminar flows described with low Reynolds numbers. In MHD systems, much of the magnetic field energy is stored at high wave numbers, which occur at smaller scales. Models must then be able to characterize high frequency features in order to successfully reproduce the trajectories of the system. These turbulent flows at higher Reynolds number are simulated, which will in turn produce higher frequency features that a model trained on smooth flows may not be able to resolve with good accuracy. To this end, transfer learning can be used to take a base model and adapt it to the new data domain by using a pre-trained checkpoint as the starting point of a new iteration of model training. \n",
