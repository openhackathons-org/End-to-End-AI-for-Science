class StormCastDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset, ABC):
    """An abstract class that defines the interface for StormCast datasets.

    All datasets must inherit from this class and implement the methods marked as @abstractmethod.
    The other methods have default implementations and can be overridden by the dataset if needed,
    for example to provide a normalization scheme.

    In addition to the methods defined below, all datasets must also implement the following:
    - `__init__`, which should accept a `params` argument containing the dataset parameters
        and a `train` argument indicating whether the dataset is for training or validation
    - `__len__`, which should return the number of samples in the dataset
    - `__getitem__`, which should return a dictionary containing the following keys:
        - `background`: a numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor of shape
            `(num_channels_background, height, width)` containing the background data
        - `state`: a 2-tuple of numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor of shape
            `(num_channels_state, height, width)` with index 0 containing the input state data
            and index 1 containing the target state data
        - `lead_time_label` (optional): this must be returned if lead_time_steps > 0. A single
            integer indicating which lead time embedding should be used
        The outputs of __getitem__ should be already normalized (this is not done in the training
        loop for performance reasons).

    An example implementation of a dataset is given in `data_loader_hrrr_era5.py`.
