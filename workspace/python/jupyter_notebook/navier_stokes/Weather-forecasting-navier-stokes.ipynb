    "\n",
    "We aim to predict the velocities for 6-hour timesteps using the Navier-Stokes equation. For this, we use the Navier-Stokes equation. The Navier–Stokes equations mathematically express the conservation of momentum and conservation of mass for Newtonian fluids. We will take a 2d projected input from the ERA5 Reanalysis dataset to be used as initial conditions for our input. We will look into the ERA5 dataset in detail in the upcoming notebooks. The process of taking the 3D sphere and projecting it onto a 2D mesh is shown in the diagram below, the 2D mesh is of the size (1440,720)\n",

There are six dependent variables; the pressure $p$, density $r$, and temperature $T$, and three components of the velocity vector; the $u$ component is in the $x$ direction, the $v$ component is in the $y$ direction, and the $w$ component is in the $z$ direction, All of the dependent variables are functions of all four independent variables.\n",

By adopting this approach, we aim to improve the efficiency and speed of our model development while ensuring that our performance metrics meet the desired criteria.

This additional resource will further expand on the concepts and techniques involved in assimilating data into physical models and demonstrate how this approach can enhance the accuracy and predictive power of the model. We encourage you to review this optional notebook, as it can provide valuable insights into the practical implementation of Physics Informed approaches in various fields, including engineering, physics, and data science. \n",

We will delve into hands-on examples to illustrate how the six-step approach can be used to solve problems using the data-driven approach, which help us to analyze and extract insights from large and complex datasets. By following this approach, we can identify patterns and trends within the data that may not be immediately evident and use this information to develop predictive models."
