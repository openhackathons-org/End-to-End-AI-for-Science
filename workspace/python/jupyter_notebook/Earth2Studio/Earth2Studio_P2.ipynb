    "**Ensemble Inference**: Ensemble inference with perturbation in weather forecasting involves generating multiple forecasts with slight variations in initial conditions or model parameters. This approach is crucial because the atmosphere is a chaotic system where small changes in initial conditions can lead to significant differences in outcomes. By using ensemble methods, we can quantify the uncertainty in predictions and provide a range of possible weather scenarios, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of forecasts, especially for extreme weather events. This method is particularly useful in deep learning models, which traditionally focus on deterministic outputs, by allowing them to incorporate probabilistic elements and better reflect the inherent uncertainties in weather prediction.\n",
