In such a setting, we can use them to approximate the solution to a given differential equation and boundary condition without any training data from other solvers. More specifically, the neural network will be trained to minimize a loss function formed using the differential equation and the boundary conditions. If the network can minimize this loss, then it will, in effect solve the given differential equation.

    "ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform application designed to visualize data sets of varying sizes from small to very large. The goals of the ParaView project include developing an open-source, multi-platform visualization application that supports distributed computational models to process large data sets. It has an open, flexible, and intuitive user interface. Furthermore, ParaView is built on an extensible architecture based on open standards. ParaView runs on distributed and shared memory parallel as well as single processor systems and has been successfully tested on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, IBM Blue Gene, Cray XT3 and various Unix workstations and clusters. Under the hood, ParaView uses the Visualization Toolkit as the data processing and rendering engine and has a user interface written using the Qt cross-platform application framework. \n",

    "        - a. Extract the downloaded package.\n",
    "        - b. Navigate to the `bin` folder and launch `pararview`\n",
    "        - c. Install any missing dependencies if prompted.\n",
    "        - d. Add the ParaView executable to your `$PATH`. Example: In bash, you can execute: `export PATH=\"/path/to/Paraview/#.#.#/bin:$PATH\"`\n",
    "5. Launch ParaView:\n",
    "    - On Windows: Search for \"ParaView\" in the Start menu and click to open.\n",
    "    - On macOS: Open ParaView from the Applications folder.\n",
    "    - On Linux: Launch the executable from the `bin` folder or if already added to `PATH`, then type paraview in the terminal or find it in your applications menu.\n",
    "6. Verify the installation: Once launched, you should see the ParaView interface with its main window and toolbars.\n"

The data can be downloaded by clicking here [Initial Conition,](outputs/projectile/constraints/IC.vtp) [Interior Constraits,](outputs/projectile/constraints/interior.vtp) [Inference Data](outputs/projectile/inferencers/inferencer_data.vtp) and [Validation Data](outputs/projectile/validators/validator.vtp).

    "ParaView is a powerful software that comes with lots of inbuilt tools to use. To get started, here's a brief introduction to using ParaView:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/paraview.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"center\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "`paraview` is the graphical front-end to the ParaView application. The UI is designed to allow you to easily create pipelines for data processing with arbitrary complexity. The UI provides panels for you to inspect and modify the pipelines, to change parameters that in turn affect the processing pipelines, to perform various data selection and inspection actions to introspect the data, and to generate renderings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start by looking at the various components of the UI. If you run paraview for the first time, you will see something similar to the above figure. The UI consists of of menus, dockable panels, toolbars, and the viewport – the central portion of the application window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Menus provide the standard set of options typical with a desktop application including options for opening/saving files (File menu), for undo/redo (Edit menu), for the toggle panel, and for toolbar visibilities (View menu). Additionally, the menus provide ways to create sources that generate test datasets of various types (Sources menu), as well new filters for processing data (Filters menu). The Tools menu provides access to some of the advanced features in paraview such as managing plugins and favorites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panels provide you with the ability to peek into the application’s state. For example, you can inspect the visualization pipeline that has been set up ( Pipeline Browser ), as well as the memory that is being used ( Memory Inspector ) and the parameters or properties for a processing module ( Properties panel). Several of the panels also allow you to change the values that are displayed, e.g., the Properties panel not only shows the processing module parameters, but it also allows you to change them. Several of the panels are context sensitive. For example, the Properties panel changes to show the parameters from the selected module as you change the active module in the Pipeline Browser .\n",
    "\n",
    "Toolbars are designed to provide quick access to common functionality. Several of the actions in the toolbar are accessible from other locations, including menus or panels. Similar to panels, some of the toolbar buttons are context sensitive and will become enabled or disabled based on the selected module or view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The viewport or the central portion of the paraview window is the area where ParaView renders results generated from the data. The containers in which data can be rendered or shown are called views. You can create several different types of views, all of which are laid out in this viewport area. By default, a 3D view is created, which is one of the most commonly used views in ParaView.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now get started with a Basic Workflow:\n",
    "- Let us download and open [Interior Constraits](outputs/projectile/constraints/interior.vtp) as this would have captured the points generated during the model training. \n",
    "- Open the `interior.vtk` in ParaView as shown below.  \n",
    "- Click on the Eye Icon to make the source visible. \n",
