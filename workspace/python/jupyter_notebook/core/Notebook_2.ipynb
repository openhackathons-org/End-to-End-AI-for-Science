    "## Problem Statement: Developing an AI model for weather forecasting using FourCastNet\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>FourCastNet</strong>, short for Fourier ForeCasting Neural Network, is a global data-driven weather forecasting model that provides accurate short to medium range global predictions at 0.25° resolution. FourCastNet generates a week long forecast in less than 2 seconds, orders of magnitude faster than the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a state-of-the-art Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model, with comparable or better accuracy. It is trained on a small subset of the ERA5 reanalysis dataset from the ECMWF, which consists of hourly estimates of several atmospheric variables at a latitude and longitude resolution of 0.25°. Given an initial condition from the ERA5 dataset as input, FourCastNet recursively applies an Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO) network to predict their dynamics at later time steps. In the current iteration, FourCastNet forecasts 20 atmospheric variables. These variables, listed in the table below, are sampled from the ERA5 dataset at a temporal resolution of 6 hours.\n",

    "## FourCastNet (Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator) \n",
    "\n",
    "FourCastNet uses Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO) model. This particular neural network architecture is appealing as it is specifically designed for high-resolution inputs and synthesizes several key recent advances in Deep Learning into one model. Namely, it combines the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) learning approach of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895\" rel=\"nofollow\">Li et al. [2021a]</a>, which has been shown to perform well in modeling challenging PDE systems, with a powerful ViT backbone.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/fcn_arch.webp\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:900px\" /></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The AFNO model is unique in that it frames the mixing operation as continuous global convolution, implemented efficiently in the Fourier domain with FFTs, which allows modeling dependencies across spatial and channel dimensions flexibly and scalably. With such a design, the spatial mixing complexity is reduced to $O(N log N)$, where $N$ is the number of image patches or tokens. This scaling allows the AFNO model to be well-suited to high-resolution data at the current 0.25◦ resolution. In the original FNO formulation, the operator learning approach showed impressive results in solving turbulent Navier-Stokes systems, so incorporating this into a data-driven atmospheric model is a natural choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the input variables on the 720 × 1440 latitude-longitude grid are projected to a 2D grid (h × w) of patches (with a small patch size p × p, where e.g., p = 8), with each patch represented as a d-dimensional token. Then, the sequence of patches are fed, along with a positional encoding, to a series of AFNO layers. Each layer, given an input tensor of patches  $h×w×d$ , performs spatial mixing followed by channel mixing. Spatial mixing happens in the Fourier domain as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Step 1</strong> : Transform tokens to the Fourier domain with \n",
    "$$z_{m,n} = [DFT(X)]_{m,n} $$\n",
    "where $m, n$ index the patch location and DFT denotes a 2D discrete Fourier transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Step 2</strong> : Apply token weighting in the Fourier domain, and promote sparsity with a Soft-Thresholding and Shrinkage operation as\n",
    "$$\\tilde{z}_{m,n} = S_λ(MLP(z_{m,n}))$$\n",
    "where $S_λ(x) = sign(x) max(|x| − λ, 0)$ with the sparsity controlling parameter $λ$, and MLP() is a 2-layer\n",
    "multi-layer perceptron with block-diagonal weight matrices, which are shared across all patches.\n",

    "We start with initializing utilities for distributed training. For this session, you have access to only 1 GPU, nevertheless we will setup the training in a distributed data parallel. This way, in the presence of multiple GPUs, we can minimize the time per epoch. Distributed utilities in Modulus are designed to simplify implementation of parallel training and make inference scripts easier by providing a unified way to configure and query parameters associated with the distributed environment. The utilities in `modulus.distributed` build on top of the utilities from `torch.distributed` and abstract out some of the complexities of setting up a distributed execution environment. For more details refer the documentation on [`modulus.distributed`](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/modulus-core/api/modulus.distributed.html).\n",

Specifically it enables you to compute ensemble forecasts of the model at a very fast speed compared to a traditional Numerical Weather Prediction models. While showcasing the ensemble computation is out of the scope of this introductory content, below we demonstrate how one can run a simple inference from a trained model. You can refer to [Earth2MIP](https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2mip) for more information about model scoring and diagnostics. "
